# Valid Anagram

- Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `t` is an _anagram_ of `s`, and `false` otherwise.
- An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

## Example 1:
```
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
```

## Example 2:
```
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
```

## Constraints:
- `1 <= s.length`, `t.length <= 5 * 104`
- `s` and `t` consist of _lowercase English letters_.

## Follow up: 
- What if the inputs contain Unicode characters? 
- How would you adapt your solution to such a case?
