# Longest Common Prefix

- Write a function to find the _longest common prefix string_ amongst an array of strings.
- If there is _no common prefix_, return an empty string `""`.


## Example 1:
```
Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"
```

## Example 2:
```
Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
```

## Constraints:
    1 <= strs.length <= 200
    0 <= strs[i].length <= 200
    strs[i] consists of only lowercase English letters.
